===================================================================
1. Use PlayOnLinux
2. Add the i386 architecture to the package manager
3. Setup `bumblebee` according to your distro's needs
4. These are the libs to install, AFAIK - [ primus-libs{,:i386} ]
5. Setup as you would regular installs on Windows
6. Start PlayOnLinux using `optirun` as this the best I've found to run the apps using the discrete GPU
